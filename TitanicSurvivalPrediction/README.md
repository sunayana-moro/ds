This project is a practical exercise in applying machine learning to the classic Titanic survival problem. We began with a comprehensive data analysis to clean and preprocess the raw data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and engineering new ones like family size to improve predictive power. The prepared data was then used to train and evaluate classification models, with a Random Forest Classifier proving to be particularly effective. This project showcases the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model development and evaluation, ultimately revealing key factors such as gender and passenger class that were instrumental in determining survival.
