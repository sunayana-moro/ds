## About the Dataset — A Digital Time Capsule

Imagine a website pumping out *thousands* of article headlines every day, over six years, all crafted with one goal in mind: **get people to click**. That was *The Examiner*. This dataset is a jaw-dropping archive of over **3 million headlines** written by roughly **21,000 different authors**—a sprawling, kinda chaotic monument to the early days of algorithm-driven journalism.

What’s wild about this? The Examiner was almost *algorithmic*—like the AI-generated headlines you see today, except decades before AI was cool. Headlines designed for clicks, clicks, and more clicks.

Here’s what blows my mind about this data:

- This was big-time content farming before “content farm” was even a phrase.
- By 2011, it was crushing the search rankings and mobile traffic charts.
- Headlines were often rushed, unsourced, and factually thin, but man, were they magnetic.
- It paints a vivid picture of how headline writing started becoming more about gaming algorithms than delivering news.

If you’ve ever wondered how digital media evolved from genuine reporting into attention-chasing clickbait machines, this dataset is *your* inside look.

## What’s Inside?

- Data spanning 2010 to 2015: over 3 million catchy, sometimes outrageous headlines.
- Columns packed with nuggets: `publish_date` (in that neat yyyymmdd format) and `headline_text`.
- We skip 2009 and 2016 because those years are messy — it’s the rise and fall, the boom and bust, the explosive start and the slow fade.

## What I’m Geeking Out About

In this project, I’m using SQL and Python to slice and dice the data like a news archaeologist.

Here’s what I’m uncovering:

- How many articles got published each month and year—and spotting those crazy spikes that scream viral moments.
- What words and phrases dominated headlines year after year.
- Seasonal rhythms of news production—because yes, even clickbait has a calendar.
- The average volume of articles, helping us make sense of a publishing frenzy that was both relentless and strangely hypnotic.

## Why This Matters

Because this is a *real* snapshot of the internet turning into the wild west of media. The Examiner’s story is a cautionary tale about what happens when content is driven by algorithms that reward sensation, not truth.

Today, AI spits out headlines like these by the millions—but this dataset shows this phenomenon wasn’t born yesterday.

Understanding this lets us ask: how do we take back control of the stories we consume? How do we spot clickbait in the wild? And how do algorithms shape our news universe?

### Final Thoughts

This isn’t just a dataset. It’s a glimpse into the *alchemy* of digital media’s click-driven evolution—a reminder that behind every headline is a story not just of news, but of our attention and how it’s commodified. 

And honestly? That’s fascinating.

So dive in, explore, question, and maybe learn a thing or two about the internet’s headline-hunting past!
