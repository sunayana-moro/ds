# Video Game Sales Data Analytics ðŸŽ®ðŸ“Š

In this project, Iâ€™m exploring the fascinating world of video game sales data. Instead of just playing the games, Iâ€™m diving into decades of sales numbers across platforms, genres, and regions to uncover patterns and insights that reveal how the gaming industry really works behind the scenes.

What excites me about this dataset is how it captures not just raw sales, but also the variety of platforms, from classic consoles to modern PCs, and how different genres appeal to audiences in North America, Europe, Japan, and beyond. I get to see who the major players are, how publisher strategies might differ, and which games become blockbusters.

Iâ€™m using SQL extensively to slice and analyze this data, learning to write powerful queries that answer nuanced business questions. For example, I investigate which platforms have maintained growth over decades, how genre popularity varies by region, and how concentrated or diversified publishers are in their portfolio. The way I combine these elements helps me understand and tell the story behind the numbers.

Alongside the technical skills, what really captivates me is drawing meaningful conclusions from the dataâ€”like identifying emerging genres with rising sales but little competition, or What is the competitive landscape by genre. Itâ€™s like piecing together a puzzle where every query brings a new piece into focus.

Ultimately, this project is both a learning journey and an exploration of an iconic and evolving cultural industry through the power of data.
